```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
all_samples <- read_csv('all_samples.csv')
all_samples_score_df <- read_csv('all_samples_score_df.csv')
all_samples_mutation_wide <- read_csv('all_samples_mutation_wide.csv')
```

All samples calls:

```{r all_samples_score_df, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(all_samples_score_df)
```

All samples details:

```{r all_samples, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(all_samples)
```

All sample mutations:

```{r all_samples_mutation_wide, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(all_samples_mutation_wide)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
